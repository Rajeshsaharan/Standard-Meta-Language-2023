(* there are two must specified things for datatypes 
first one is -> build datatypes and second one is access them
second is : -> how to access them 


there are two aspects to accessing value

1. check which varient it made /which constructor are used to made this
2. extract the data (if the any varient or constrct avilable ) [in the case of Pizza constructor there is no data only tag or avilable]


watch -> case expression
